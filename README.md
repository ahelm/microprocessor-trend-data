# README

This repository contains the raw data used for my personal analysis of Microprocessor Trend. 
The data related to the years before 2018 are just copied by Karl's repo. New data were collected by the Intel and AMD wiki websites.
Additionally, a python script is added to plot the data and generate the *svg* image.
**Please note** that the new data and the new analysis will take some working days.
